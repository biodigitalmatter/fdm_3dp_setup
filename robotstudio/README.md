# ABB Robotstudio with 3DP Power Pac

## Install ABB Robotstudio

[Download installer for ABB RobotStudio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio)

You need to provide personal information to download the software.

Extract the zip file after the download has finished and run setup.exe in the
RobotStudio folder.

During setup when asked for license, either use the trial (30 days) or the
license server at LTH (robotstudio.cs.lth.se). If you are not at LTH you will
need to use [LTH's
VPN](https://luservicedesk.service-now.com/support_en?id=kb_article_en&sys_id=3fcba671db7c6c506452cd4d0b96198c).

If you use the license server at LTH you will need to have access to the license
server whenever you run Robotstudio, unless you "check-out" a license[^footnote-robotstudio-check-out].

## Install RobotStudio 3D Printing PowerPac

To find the download link go to [RobotStudioÂ® 3D Printing
PowerPac](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/application-software/3d-printing-powerpac)
and scroll down to "Downloads for 3D Printing PowerPac". Select software in the
column to the left and download the latest version.

Extract the zip file.

Open RobotStudio: In the Ribbon find `Add-Ins > Packages > Install` and then
locate the installation file from the extracted zip file with the file extension `.rspak`.

You will find a new icon named 3D printing in the Add-on ribbon after a restart of RobotStudio[^footnote-find-3dp-button].

## Setting up robot station

There's a [prepared "pack-and-go" file that you can "unpack-and-work" with in
this directory](./V_LTH2400_RW612.rspag).

Before unpacking though you will need to make sure that you have the correct
RobotWare version installed.

You will find RobotWare version 6 and 7 in `Add-ins > Gallery`. It's usually the
first two ones. Select "Robotware for IRC5". In side panel to the right select
`6.12.04` and click `Add`.

After you have installed this you can go ahead and open the pack-and-go file. Go
to `File > Share > Unpack and work`.

After clicking through the wizard and waiting a bit you'll see "Controller
status: 1/1" in green in the bottom right controller.

You can find manuals and tutorials under `File > Help`. Both the RobotStudio
help here as well as the manuals for IRC5 are helpful.

## Starting 3DP PowerPac

In your station (created from the pack-and-go file) you can now open the 3DP
tool. Go to `Add-Ins > PowerPacs > 3D Printing`.

Instructions on how to use the PowerPac can be found in the 3DP ribbon under
`3DP Help > Application manual`.

## Footnotes

[^footnote-robotstudio-check-out]:
    You can check out a license for up to 90
    days. This allows you to run RobotStudio even when offline. You can check
    out a license using the Activation Wizard found under `File > Options > Licensing`.

[^footnote-find-3dp-button]:
    If not, make sure to check that RobotStudio has
    found your license server (or that you have a valid checked out license or
    trial license). You will find messages regarding licensing in the tab labelled output near the bottom of the screen in RobotStudio.
